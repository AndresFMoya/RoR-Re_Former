# Forms in Ruby on Rails

This project consist of building some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides.

## Technologies used

- Ruby on Rails
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- Stickler
- Rubocop
- IDE (RubyMine)

## Installation
  
  To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:
  
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/AndresFMoya/RoR-Re_Former.git
  $ cd RoR-Re_Former
  ```
  
  Then install the needed gems (while skipping any gems needed only in production):
  
  ```
  $ bundle install --without production
  ```
  
  Next, migrate the database:
  
  ```
  $ rails db:migrate
  ```
  
  Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
  
  ```
  $ rails test
  ```
  
  If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:
  
  ```
  $ rails server
  ```
